2 Bond Portfolio Management
Part 1
Use the pricing equation of a fixed-coupon bond to price each of the above bonds. I recommend
writing a function that takes yield, coupon, face value, and maturity as its main arguments. The
resulting prices should correspond to the ones reported above. Hence, you should plot the computed
prices against the reported ones. This should result in a 45-degree line.
 

Part 2
Prices should reflect investors’ perception of future interest rates. Rather than computing the
prices using yields as the case in the previous question, in practice, it is the other way around.
We try to deduce yields from market prices. Hence, given a pricing function, you need to find the
yield that matches the market price. For each bond, find the implied yield and plot it against the
corresponding yield reported in the table above. Again, this should result in a 45-degree line. (6
Points)
Part 3
Compute and report the Macaulay duration for each of the 8 US bonds. Ideally, you should report
this in two 2Å~4 tables, where the first row corresponds to the bond number and the second to the
Macaulay duration. The first table refers to the data from 2018 and the second to 2019. Given
both tables, how do they compare? Provide some rationale.
Part 4
Using first order Taylor expansion, calculate the change in the Treasury bond prices, if the yield
curve in the US shifts up by 25 bps. Focus only on the recent bond data to answer this part, i.e. bonds numbered 5, 6, 7, and 8 . To summarize, plot both the original and new prices against
maturity. How do you justify this observation?
Part 5
Assume that the prices in the above table reflect the dollar price of each bond, e.g. the price of
bond 5 is $100.06. As a portfolio manager, you need to allocate $100,000 between bond 5 and 6
from the above table. If you believe that the interest rate will increase in the near future, you need
to limit your portfolio duration to 3 years. As a result, how many units of each bond you need to
purchase to satisfy this? How would your answer change if you target a duration of 6 years instead?
Explain why these numbers make sense.
Part 6
Consider the details from the previous question. However, in this case, you need
to allocate $100,000 among the four Treasury bonds numbered 5, 6, 7, and 8. If you are targeting
a portfolio duration of 6 years, how many units of each bond you need to buy? The position in
each one of the four bonds should not be zero.
